**Backend Infrastructure Setup**

1. Create a controller for each of the games. ALtho in this first one, we are doing just one game. But we will definitely have other games later.
   2.The Node ts server talks to firebase for db and uses wesockets from ws for websocket connectivity.
2. For the firebase credentials, simply create a firebase config file and env file also. I'll add the configs to the env file.
